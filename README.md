Losely uses the book Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach.

## [Computer Networks (CS 6250)](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6250-computer-networks)
Aspirationally, I will be doing either of the following in complement to CN:
* [Hands-On Network Programming with C (GitHub repo)](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Network-Programming-with-C) (perhaps studying the code in combination with ChatGPT4)
* Mathematical programming in Python (more likely; the course uses Python and I'm fluent)

My objective is to develop a distinct, concrete, and practical project by the end of the course that integrates mathematics and can potentially be executed as code. For a glimpse into the initial planning phase, see this exploratory conversation I had with ChatGPT4: [Exploratory Conversation with ChatGPT4](https://chat.openai.com/share/af80df71-53b0-45c0-b45f-d01e0076bfc8).

## Mathematics
Relevant areas to this course:
* Graph Theory: 
  * applications: routing protocols, network topologies, and algorithms like Spanning Tree Protocol and Distance Vector Routing
* Probability and Statistics
  * analyzing network performance, error rates, and in the study of Internet measurements and analytics
* Linear Algebra
  * network traffic modeling and in optimizations for routing and resource allocation
* Optimization Techniques
  * network design, congestion control, and in the implementation of Software Defined Networking (SDN)
* Information Theory
  * error control and data compression techniques used in network communications
* Fourier Analysis
  * signal processing within the network context, particularly useful in multimedia applications that handle voice and video transmissions
